            <h2 class="center-text"><strong>Exploring Supervisors’ Experiences with the Supervision House Activity:</strong></h2>
            <h3 class="center-text"><strong>A Mixed-Methods Study</strong></h3>
            <p class="center-text"><strong>Principal Investigator (PI):</strong> Minnie (Minyi) Li</p>
            <p class="center-text"><strong>Faculty Advisor (FA):</strong> Professor Douglas Guiffrida</p>
            
            <p>This form describes a research study that is being conducted by Minnie (Minyi) Li (PI) and Professor Douglas Guiffrida (FA) from the University of Rochester’s Warner School of Education.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Purpose of Study</strong></p>
            <p>The outlined study will be conducted to fulfill the requirements for the PI’s PhD degree in Counseling at the University of Rochester Warner School of Education. This study explores the supervisors-in-training’s experiences in self-reflecting on their developmental needs and tasks using the Supervision House tool, an activity originally used among counselors-in-training (Lupton-Smith et al., 2023).</p>
            
            <p><strong>Description of Study Procedures</strong></p>
            <p>This study will take place completely remotely. If you decide to take part in this study, you will be asked to complete a screening and demographic form (a Qualtrics survey) to check eligibility. If you are eligible, you will complete the Supervision House activity (an offline computer-based activity) and an evaluation questionnaire (a Qualtrics survey) independently, which will take about 60 minutes. You will also be invited to attend an optional post-activity interview with the PI (via Zoom), which will take about 60 minutes. The interviews will be conducted on an ongoing basis and will stop once data saturation is reached.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Number of Subjects</strong></p>
            <p>This study will include 30-50 subjects enrolled in a CACREP-accredited doctoral counseling program within the U.S.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Payments</strong></p>
            <p>A $15 Amazon gift card will be given to the 30-50 subjects who complete the Supervision House activity and evaluation questionnaire within three weeks of receiving the research invitation email. An additional $25 Amazon gift card will be given to the 10-15 subjects who complete the post-activity interview within three weeks of receiving the interview invitation email.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Funding Source</strong></p>
            <p>This study received the $400 Doctoral Student Dissertation Funding Award from the University of Rochester Warner School of Education. All funding will be used for payments to subjects.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Benefits of Participation</strong></p>
            <p>While you may not receive any direct benefit, your participation will contribute to a better understanding of supervisor development, which could benefit future educational practices and policies.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Costs</strong></p>
            <p>There will be no cost to you to participate in this study.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Risks of Subject</strong></p>
            <p>The potential risk to subjects is expected to be minimal. However, you might experience emotional discomfort when reflecting on personal experiences or confronting vulnerable questions. In the event that you begin to exhibit any signs of stress, the PI will stop the research activity and encourage you to connect with a professional counselor. In addition, despite all measures to maintain confidentiality, personal information could be inadvertently disclosed. The transfer of personal information through the Internet carries inherent risks, and the security of your data transmitted through the Internet is not guaranteed.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Future Use of Information/Samples</strong></p>
            <p>The data will be retained for three years. Your information may be distributed or used for future research studies without additional informed consent. Identifying information will be removed before your information is used or distributed.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Confidentiality of Records</strong></p>
            <p>The University of Rochester (UR) makes every effort to keep the information collected from you private. To ensure this, only Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved software — UR Box, NVivo, Qualtrics, SPSS, and Excel — will be used for data management and data analysis. All documents will be transferred from the PI’s passcode-protected personal laptop within the same day and securely stored in a restricted folder on UR Box. Only the PI and the FA have access to the folder. Identifying information (i.e., your name, your email address, and the name of your university) will be omitted from the dissertation as well as from potential publications, such as conference presentations and journal articles. You will be assigned a participant number to use during the research, and a pseudonym will be used in publications to protect your confidentiality.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Commercial Profit</strong></p>
            <p>The study researchers will use your information for research only. However, the results of this research might someday lead to the development of products that a company could sell. You will not receive money from the sale of any such product.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Circumstances for Dismissal</strong></p>
            <p>You may be withdrawn from the study (i.e., your participation may be stopped without your consent) if you cannot complete the Supervision House activity and evaluation questionnaire within one month after you receive the research invitation email.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Use of E-mail in Research</strong></p>
            <p>You will receive communications about this study via email. Email may be sent or received in an unencrypted (unprotected) manner. Therefore, there is a risk that the content of the communication, including your personal information, could be shared beyond you and the study researchers. Your consent below indicates that you understand this risk. The University of Rochester is not responsible for any interception of messages sent through email.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Voluntary Participation</strong></p>
            <p>Taking part in this study is voluntary. You are free to decline participation or withdraw for any reason. Regardless of your decision, there will be no penalty and no impact on your academic, professional, or social standing. If you feel hesitant, you are encouraged to refrain from participating. If you choose to withdraw from the study, any information you have already provided will be deleted. You may withdraw at any time up to two weeks after submitting your data. After this period, data analysis may have begun, and your information may be included in the research results. If you wish to withdraw, please contact Minnie (Minyi) Li at <a href="mailto:mli96@u.rochester.edu">mli96@u.rochester.edu</a>.</p>
