            <h2 class="center-text"><strong>Exploring Supervisors’ Experiences with the Supervision House Activity:</strong></h2>
            <h3 class="center-text"><strong>A Mixed-Methods Study</strong></h3>
            <p class="center-text">Principal Investigator (PI): Minnie (Minyi) Li</p>
            <p class="center-text">Faculty Advisor (FA): Dr. Douglas Guiffrida</p>
            <p>This form describes a research study that is being conducted by Minnie (Minyi) Li (PI) and Dr. Douglas Guiffrida (FA) from the University of Rochester’s Warner School of Education.</p>

            <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose of Study</h3>
            <p>This study explores the supervisors-in-training’s experiences in self-reflecting on their developmental needs and tasks using the Supervision House tool, an activity originally used among counselors-in-training (Lupton-Smith et al., 2023).</p>

            <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Description of Study Procedures</h3>
            <p>This study will take place completely remotely. If you decide to take part in this study, you will be asked to complete a screening and demographic form (a Qualtrics survey) to check eligibility. If you are eligible, you will complete the Supervision House activity (a computer-based activity) and an evaluation questionnaire (a Qualtrics survey) independently, which will take 30-60 minutes. You will also be invited to attend an optional post-activity interview with the PI (via Zoom), which will take an additional 30-60 minutes. The interviews will be conducted on an ongoing basis and will stop once data saturation (i.e., no additional themes are being found from collecting more data) is reached.</p>

            <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Number of Subjects</h3>
            <p>This study will include up to 50 subjects enrolled in a CACREP-accredited doctoral counseling program within the U.S. Up to 15 subjects will participate in the optional post-activity interview.</p>

            <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Payments</h3>
            <p>You will receive a $15 Amazon gift card if you complete the Supervision House activity and evaluation questionnaire within <u>three weeks</u> of receiving the research invitation email. You will receive an additional $25 Amazon gift card if you complete the post-activity interview within <u>three weeks</u> of receiving the interview invitation email.</p>

            <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Benefits of Participation</h3>
            <p>There are no expected benefits from your participation.</p>

            <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Costs</h3>
            <p>There will be no cost to you to participate in this study.</p>

            <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Risks of Subject</h3>
            <p>The potential risk to you is expected to be minimal. You may skip any questions you do not want to answer, take a break, or stop participating in the study any time. However, you might experience emotional discomfort when reflecting on personal experiences or confronting vulnerable questions. If you experienced any distress or found yourself in crisis while completing the research activity, please do not hesitate to stop it and reach out for professional support. You can contact the National Crisis Hotline by calling 988 or visit your nearest emergency room for immediate assistance. In addition, despite all measures to maintain confidentiality, personal information could be inadvertently disclosed. The University of Rochester makes every effort to keep the information collected from you private. The protections the researcher has put in place to protect against breach of privacy are: 1) transferring all electronic data to the University of Rochester Box account to which only the PI and the faculty advisor have access from the PI’s password-protected personal laptop within same day, 2) using a pseudonym for you and your university in data analysis, the dissertation paper, and all accompanying documents and samples, and 3) storing information identifying you and your university in a secure electronic spreadsheet separate from all other documents. Sometimes, however, researchers need to share information that may identify you with people who work for the University of Rochester. If this does happen, we will take precautions to protect the information you have provided.</p>

            <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Future Use of Information/Samples</h3>
            <p>The data will be retained for three years. Your information may be distributed or used for future research studies without additional informed consent. Results of the research may be presented at meetings or in publications, but your name and the name of your university will not be used.</p>

            <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Confidentiality of Records</h3>
            <p>The University of Rochester makes every effort to keep the information collected from you private. In order to do so, we will only use the software approved by the University of Rochester’s Institutional Review Board (i.e., Box, Excel, NVivo, Qualtrics, SPSS, and Zoom) for data collection and analysis. For data management, we will transfer the data from the PI’s passcode-protected personal laptop on the same day and securely store it in the University of Rochester Box. All interviews will be recorded using the local recording feature on the University of Rochester Zoom and stored on the PI’s password-protected laptop. Zoom does not provide an audio-only recording option; instead, it generates both an audio file and a video-audio file after the recording is completed. Only the audio file will be saved and analyzed. The video-audio file will be retained as a backup until the transcripts are generated, after which it will be permanently deleted. Sometimes, however, researchers need to share information that may identify you with people who work for the University of Rochester. If this does happen, we will take precautions to protect the information you have provided. Results of the research may be presented at meetings or in publications, but your name and the name of your university will not be used.</p>

            <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Use of E-mail in Research</h3>
            <p>You will receive communications about this study via email. Email may be sent or received in an unencrypted (unprotected) manner. Therefore, there is a risk that the content of the communication, including your personal information, could be shared beyond you and the study researchers. Your consent below indicates that you understand this risk. The University of Rochester is not responsible for any interception of messages sent through email.</p>

            <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Voluntary Participation</h3>
            <p>Taking part in this study is voluntary. You are free to decline participation or withdraw for any reason. Regardless of your decision, there will be no penalty and no impact on your academic, professional, or social standing. If you feel hesitant, you are encouraged to refrain from participating. If you choose to withdraw from the study, any information you have already provided will be deleted. You may withdraw at any time up to <u>two weeks</u> after submitting your data. After this period, data analysis may have begun, and your information may be included in the research results. If you wish to withdraw, please contact Minnie (Minyi) Li at <a href="mailto:mli96@u.rochester.edu">mli96@u.rochester.edu</a>.</p>
